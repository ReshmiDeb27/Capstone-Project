Executive Project Summary: AI-Powered Imaging Technology for Enhancing Dental Examinations
Fear of visiting the dentist is a common issue, especially among children and elderly patients. The intimidating dental environment, filled with complex equipment, bright lights, and sharp instruments, can discourage individuals from seeking timely dental care. Additionally, conventional dental examinations require healthcare professionals to manually inspect each tooth, which is time-consuming, can cause discomfort, and may lead to missed early signs of decay. Current diagnostic tools such as X-rays, including Orthopantomograms (OPG) and bitewing X-rays, offer effective imaging solutions but come with drawbacks. They require scheduled appointments, can be costly, and may not always be covered by insurance. These limitations highlight the need for an alternative solution that enhances efficiency, improves patient comfort, and reduces diagnostic errors. This project aims to introduce AI-powered imaging technology as a transformative approach to dental examinations. High-resolution images of the oral cavity, captured from multiple angles (occlusal, buccal, and lingual), will be analyzed using machine learning algorithms such as YOLO for object detection. This approach will allow accurate identification of cavities and early signs of decay without invasive procedures or traditional probing methods.
