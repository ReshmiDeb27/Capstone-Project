## Literature Review

Recent advancements in AI-driven dental imaging have demonstrated promising results in improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. AbuSalim et al. (2024) introduced a multi-granularity approach using YOLO-based object detection models for effective tooth detection and classification. Their findings suggest that AI-powered imaging can significantly enhance diagnostic precision, reducing errors associated with manual inspections. Furthermore, Ramírez-Pedraza et al. (2025) explored deep learning applications in oral hygiene, specifically focusing on automated dental plaque detection using the YOLO framework. Their study highlights the potential of AI models in improving preventive dental care by offering real-time detection and quantification of dental plaque using the O’Leary Index. These advancements indicate a growing trend toward AI integration in dentistry, paving the way for innovative solutions that minimize patient discomfort while optimizing clinical workflows. 
This project proposes the development and implementation of an AI-driven imaging system to modernize dental diagnostics. The specific objectives are to improve accuracy by utilizing machine learning-based object detection to enhance early cavity detection and reduce missed diagnoses. It aims to reduce costs by providing a cost-effective alternative to traditional X-rays, minimizing the need for expensive imaging equipment and additional fees. The project seeks to enhance the patient experience by offering a non-invasive, stress-free examination method, especially for patients with dental anxiety. Additionally, it ensures ethical and safe practices by reducing reliance on radiation-based diagnostics and minimizing discomfort through advanced imaging technology. Finally, it simplifies dental clinic operations by decreasing the need for excessive sterilization equipment, making the workflow more efficient and reducing hospital overhead costs.
