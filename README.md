# Executive Project Summary
## Problem statement:  

Visiting the dentist often causes fear, especially in children and elderly patients, due to the overwhelming dental environment filled with equipment like dental chairs, lights, and sharp instruments. This fear can stop the patients from seeking timely dental care. Additionally, traditional dental examinations are time-consuming as healthcare professionals manually inspect each tooth, which can lead to discomfort for patients and a chance of missing small cavities or early signs of decay.  This is my area of interest because I have seen many people neglecting their oral hygiene because of fear, mainly in kids, and it is a time-consuming procedure.  

Although X-rays, such as Orthopantomograms (OPG) and bitewing X-rays, are commonly used to identify dental issues, they also have certain drawbacks. They are time-consuming, involve scheduling appointments, and may not always be covered by insurance, making them costly for patients. There is a need for a faster, less stressful, and cost-effective solution to improve the dental examination process and reduce errors. 

 
## Project goals: 

Using AI-powered imaging technology to modify dental examinations. High-resolution images of the oral cavity will be captured from various angles (occlusal, buccal, and lingual) to provide detailed views of each tooth. These images will be processed using machine learning algorithms, such as YOLO for object detection, to accurately identify cavities or early signs of decay without time-consuming procedures involving probing or mirrors. 

- Improve accuracy in detecting dental problems, reducing the chances of missing cavities.   

- Provide a cost-effective alternative to X-rays by eliminating the need for expensive imaging equipment and associated fees.   

- Improve the overall patient experience by minimizing discomfort and stress.   

- Offer ethical, non-invasive, and safe methods for dental examinations.   

- It reduces the need for a lot of sterilization equipment and instruments in dental hospitals, making the process simpler and easier to manage. 

## Project Merit: 

This project will benefit both patients and healthcare professionals. For patients who are scared of dental treatments, especially kids and elderly people, this technology can help reduce fear by making the examination process faster and more comfortable. It can encourage more people to visit the dentist without hesitation. For hospitals and clinics, it reduces the need for expensive equipment like X-ray machines and reduces the burden of sterilizing and buying multiple instruments. This can save time, money, and resources while improving the overall quality of care. 

## Project Timeline (3 Months) 

This project follows a structured timeline to ensure efficient execution and completion within three months.

## Methodology
This study will build upon previous research but integrate the latest advancements in object detection, specifically utilizing YOLOv8 for multi-granularity tooth analysis and automated dental plaque detection. The research model will follow a data-driven approach, leveraging high-resolution intraoral images to train and validate AI models for tooth classification, cavity detection, and plaque quantification. The methodology will include data collection from diverse dental case studies, preprocessing and augmentation of images, and iterative model training and validation to ensure robustness and accuracy. By employing an updated YOLOv8 framework, the study will refine the detection accuracy beyond prior research models, ensuring enhanced performance in real-time clinical settings.
